The symptoms were that certain <strong>Pending</strong> pods were stuck in that state with errors stating both &ldquo;Insufficient CPU&rdquo; and &ldquo;Insufficient Memory&rdquo;.

<p>Turns out the problem was resolved via a restart of the Kubernetes API Servers. For more details, please take a look at <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/45237">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/45237</a>. According to some people in the comments section of the issue, it looks like the issue is resolved in etcd 3.0.17 (and above? hopefully?).</p>
