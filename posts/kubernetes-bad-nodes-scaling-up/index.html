    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Encountered a very serious Kubernetes issue that almost led to a full cluster outage. The symptoms were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kube API Server sometimes become unresponsive and from time to time returned the error message: <code>Error from server: client: etcd cluster is unavailable or misconfigured; error #0: unexpected EOF</code></li>
<li>Many pods were stuck on <strong>Pending</strong> or <strong>Terminating</strong> state</li>
<li>etcd CPU and network traffic spiked up dramatically from normal levels</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagnosis of the problem was that we had to increase our cluster capacity by 50% for a large batch job and new nodes (they had a minor version update) created in the cluster seems to have a yet to be unidentified issue that was causing kubelet on these nodes to throw lots and lots of errors. I suspect that these errors flooded the API Server with messages and requests causing a cascade of failures on nodes that previously worked.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the solution to the problem was to terminate the new nodes and eventually the cluster recovered itself (mostly&hellip;). For more information about the next issue I encounted trying to full recover pods that were stuck on <strong>Pending</strong>, please see <a href="/posts/kubernetes-scheduling-fail-insufficient-cpu-memory/">here</a>.</p>
